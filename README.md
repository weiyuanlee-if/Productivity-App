This is a To Do List app made with HTML/CSS/Javascript. It is responsive without the use of a CSS framework. I used this typical app idea to build the fundamentals of Javascript and DOM, with the adding and removal of list items, and modifying CSS. I then added other features such as a light and dark mode, list item filter, clear all button, edit button, authentication, and local storage.
