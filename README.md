This is a To Do List with Kanban features. I did a To Do List first in Vanilla JS to learn the basics. Then I will add other features such as responsiveness, Kanban, user profiles, and animation with Angular.

This project is created to master JS basics and attempt Angular. Since Angular is commonly used with .NET developers and C# is my favorite coding language, this project is merely a preparation for future projects involving Angular.

To Be Done:

1. Complete HTML/CSS and Vanilla JS

2. Angular To Do

3. Angular Kanban

4. Pomodoro (optional)
